### Fitness Assessments

Chapter 6, Appendix E

## Overview of Fitness Assessments

- 2.5 hours a week of moderate aerobic physical activity can substantially
  reduce the risk of chronic diseases and musculoskelatal pain
  - 31 % of adults do this
  - 3 sessions of 20 minute high intensity or 5 sessions of 30 minute moderate

#### Definition

- If a client has high-risk health stuff or shows some serious problems, _refer
  that client_. You are not a doctor, you can create exercise programs, you _can
  not_ prescribe anything ever.
- Objective information is anything you measure. Subjective information is
  anything else _including_ medical info.

#### Subjective Info

- Perform health screenings before any physical activity
- **PAR-Q** Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire
  - Aimed at identifying individuals who require further medical evaluation
    before being allowed to exercise due to high risk for cardiovascular disease
  - Focus on learning about lifestyle and occupation

##### General Health History

- Occupation
  - If they sit all day, then hips are flexed for long periods and tight hip
    flexors (Rectus Femoris, TFL, Iliopsoas), shoulder protraction, forward
    head lean, bad cardio
  - Repetitive movements which can cause pattern overload
  - High heels forces plantarflexion and can cause tightness in calves
    leading to decreased dorsiflexion and foot pronation
  - Stress can lead to poor breathing and thus poor movementin back, shoulders,
    chest, etc

##### Medical History

- Past injuries
  - Ankle sprains can lead to bad control of butt and thus poor lower limbs
    movement and control  
  - Knee injuries can be from ankle/hip dysfunctions or contact activity and
    lead to injury from poor control of knee like patella
  - Low back injuries can mess with your core which effect the whole body
  - Shoulder injuries

##### Chronic Conditions and Meds

- 75% does not engage in 30 minutes of low-to-moderate physical activity most
  days
- Beta Blockers can drop heart rate and blood pressure

## Objective Information

#### Heart Rate

- Heart Rate (_HR_) is good for general health while exercise HR is best for how
  cardioresp. system is responding. Aka pulse rate.
- Grab Radial Pulse in the morning when waking up. Count pulses in 60 secs
- Typical resting HR is 70-80 BPM
- _Maximal HR_ Calculate 220-age for HR Max, then target zones 1-3 by
  multiplying the HR Max by .65-.75 (1), .76-.85 (2), .86-.95 (3)
- _HR Reserve_  (Karvonen), Target = ((_HR Max_ - _HR Resting_) * desired intensity) + _HR Resting_
  - HR and Oxygen intake are linearly related  

#### Blood Pressure

- Pressure of blood against walls of vessels
- _Systolic_ Top number, pressure when heart contracts
- _Diastolic_ Bottom number, pressure when heart relaxed and filling with blood
  - <=120 / <=80 is good!

#### Body Composition

- 3-5% is essential, 5-13% athletic,
- _Skinfold measurement_ measure subcutaneous tissue. Not for overweight, use
  circumference measures. Measure with biceps, triceps, suscapular, iliac crest
  on right side of body
- BMI 25-30 is overweight
