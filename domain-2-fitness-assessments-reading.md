### Fitness Assessments

Chapter 6, Appendix E

## Overview of Fitness Assessments

- 2.5 hours a week of moderate aerobic physical activity can substantially
  reduce the risk of chronic diseases and musculoskelatal pain
  - 31 % of adults do this
  - 3 sessions of 20 minute high intensity or 5 sessions of 30 minute moderate

#### Definition

- If a client has high-risk health stuff or shows some serious problems, _refer
  that client_. You are not a doctor, you can create exercise programs, you _can
  not_ prescribe anything ever.
- Objective information is anything you measure. Subjective information is
  anything else _including_ medical info.

#### Subjective Info

- Perform health screenings before any physical activity
- **PAR-Q** Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire
  - Aimed at identifying individuals who require further medical evaluation
    before being allowed to exercise due to high risk for cardiovascular disease
  - Focus on learning about lifestyle and occupation

##### General Health History

- Occupation
  - If they sit all day, then hips are flexed for long periods and tight hip
    flexors (Rectus Femoris, TFL, Iliopsoas), shoulder protraction, forward
    head lean, bad cardio
  - Repetitive movements which can cause pattern overload
  - High heels forces plantarflexion and can cause tightness in calves
    leading to decreased dorsiflexion and foot pronation
  - Stress can lead to poor breathing and thus poor movementin back, shoulders,
    chest, etc

##### Medical History

- Past injuries
  - Ankle sprains can lead to bad control of butt and thus poor lower limbs
    movement and control  
  - Knee injuries can be from ankle/hip dysfunctions or contact activity and
    lead to injury from poor control of knee like patella
  - Low back injuries can mess with your core which effect the whole body
  - Shoulder injuries

##### Chronic Conditions and Meds

- 75% does not engage in 30 minutes of low-to-moderate physical activity most
  days
- Beta Blockers can drop heart rate and blood pressure

## Objective Information

#### Heart Rate

- Heart Rate (_HR_) is good for general health while exercise HR is best for how
  cardioresp. system is responding. Aka pulse rate.
- Grab Radial Pulse in the morning when waking up. Count pulses in 60 secs
- Typical resting HR is 70-80 BPM
- _Maximal HR_ Calculate 220-age for HR Max, then target zones 1-3 by
  multiplying the HR Max by .65-.75 (1), .76-.85 (2), .86-.95 (3)
- _HR Reserve_  (Karvonen), Target = ((_HR Max_ - _HR Resting_) * desired intensity) + _HR Resting_
  - HR and Oxygen intake are linearly related  

#### Blood Pressure

- Pressure of blood against walls of vessels
- _Systolic_ Top number, pressure when heart contracts
- _Diastolic_ Bottom number, pressure when heart relaxed and filling with blood
  - <=120 / <=80 is good!

#### Body Composition

- 3-5% is essential, 5-13% athletic,
- _Skinfold measurement_ measure subcutaneous tissue. Not for overweight, use
  circumference measures. Measure with biceps, triceps, suscapular, iliac crest
  on right side of body
- BMI 25-30 is overweight

## Assessments

#### Cardiorespiratory Assessments

- Need to measure maximal oxygen uptake (VO2_max) but need to approximate it
  with approximations thus cardiorespiratory assessments
- _YMCA 3-Minute Step Test_ climb stairs for 3 minutes, then take pulse
  - Very poor - below average -> Zone 1, average - good -> zone 2, excellent ->3
- _Rockport Walk Test_ Record weight, walk a mile quickly, then take HR, then
  do some crazy fucking math for a vo2 score.
  - Poor - fair -> zone 1, average - good -> 2, very good -> 3
  - Designed to be a cardiovascular starting point

**THINK** Shitty to kinda shitty -> 1, avg to almost amazing -> 2, amazing -> 3

#### Posture and Movement Assessments

- Proper postural alignment allows optimal NM efficiency, allowing for proper
  arthrokinematics, proper length-tension relationships for force couples, etc

###### Common Distortion Patterns

- _Pronation Distortion Syndrome_ flat foot (pronation) and knock knees (adducted
  and internally rotated)
  - Shortened/tight/etc: anything related to foot eversion (which would cause
    flat feet), leg adduction/internal rotation, and hip flexion (and the bicep
    femoris for some reason)
    - Foot eversion: Peroneals, gastroc., soleus
    - Leg adduction: adductors, iliotibial (IT) head
    - Hip flexion: hip flexors
  - Lengthened/weak: antagonist to the above (so foot inversion, hip extension,
    hip abduction, hip external rotation)
    - Inversion: tibials
    - Abductions: glutes
- _Lower Cross Syndrome_ anterior pelvic tilt with arched back. Overactive
  muscles are similar to pronated foot distortion except add the back
  - gastroc/soleus, hip flexors, adductors, _lats_, and _erector spinae_
  - **THINK** booty poppin, so can't flatten out the front and back will contract
    to provide the booty pop
- _Upper Cross Syndrome_ forward head and protracted shoulders
  - **THINK** shoulders are up and curved forward and around so anything to pull
    the shoulders up and around will be tight/shortened. Even muscles that would
    _push_ these muscles up
  - Quiz Questions: Shortened muscles include scalenes
- _Kinetic Chain Checkpoints_ are major joint regions that bear a lot of weight
  or drastically change motion
  - feet/ankles, knees, LPHC, shoulders, head/neck

###### Dynamic Posture Assessments

- looking at movements

- _OSA_ Overhead Squat Assessment
  - assess dynamic flexibility, core strength, balance, and NM control
  - Forward Lean Compensation: implies overactive calves (gastoc/sol) and
    overactive hip/spine flexion (hip flexors/abs) and underactive dorsiflexion
    (ant tib) hip ext (glutes)
  - Low Back Arch: implies overactive hip flexion and back (erector spinae/lats)
    and underactive hip ext (glutes/hams/core)
  - Arms Falling Forward: implies overactive back (lats and teres maj) and chest
    (pecs) and underactive mid back (mid/low traps/rhomboids) and shoulders
    (rotator cuff)
  - Feet Turn Out: fucking magically remember that gastroc and some hamstring
    complex are both weak and strong here? Overworked muscles are laterally
    located and weak muscles are medially located. Overworked also includes some
    external hip rotation muscles
  - Knees Move in: overworked is anything adductor or internal rotation,
    underactive (lengthened) is anything with external rotation
- _Single Leg Squat_ Squat to assess lower extremity movement patters.
  - Movement distortions and dysfunctions parallel OSA determined ones with
    similar over/underactive muscles (mostly knock knees)
- _Pushing_ Assess pushing movements. Similar to upper extremity stuff in OHA
  (low back arch, shoulder protraction) but add head forward. Overactive muscles
  for forward head are ones for raising shoulders and pulling head forward while
  underactive is cervical flexors (pull head back)
- _Pulling_ pulling assessment. Same over/underactive checks as pulling with
  same over/underactive muscles

###### Performance Assessments

- _Pushup Test_ test muscular endurance of upper body mostly pushing muscles
- _Davies Test_ upper extremity agility and stabilization. Kind of in a pushup,
  but wider, and have client reach across and touch other hand, repeat and
  alternate.
- _Shark Skill Test_ lower extremity agility and NM control. Hop in the boxes on
  one foot!
- **THINK** Sharks don't have arms and can't do pushups but all Davies have arms
  (take that sharks, thank you evolution)
- _Bench Press Strength Assessment_ Do some bench presses with long cool downs.
  Increase weights by 5-10% between sets.
- _Squat Strength Assessment_ Same as bench but increase load by 10-20%
