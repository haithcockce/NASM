#### Hypertrophy-Related Responses and Adaptations to Exercise Stress

## Neuromuscular System

#### Structure and Function

- Muscle is encased in layers of connected tissue. Within the encasement is 
  bundles of fiber with their own incasement. The bundles contain tons of 
  individual fibers covered by their own encasement
  - _Epimysium_ the outermost encasement
  - _Fasciculi_ the bundles of fiber in the muscle
  - _Perimysium_ encasements around the fasciculi
  - _Endomysium_ encasements around the individual fibers 
  - _Myocytes_ individual muscle fibers. 
  - Muscles are bundles of fasciculi which are bundles of myocytes 
- Skeletal muscles (muscles attached to bones) have multiple nuclei 
  (_multinucleated_) which allows protein production and thus growth 
- A single fiber (myocyte) contains tons of _myofibrils_, rod-like units in the
  fibers.
  - Myofibrils are long stacks of _sarcomeres_ connected end-to-end 
  - Sarcomeres contain thin and thick filaments which pass each other to 
    contract as part of the _Sliding Filament Theory_ to move muscles.
- Fiber Types
  - _Slow Twitch_ Type I fibers, slow to reach peak tension time (relatively
    speaking, still reach it in 110ms). Appear red due to higher levels of 
    myoglobin (more things to store oxygen) and thus fatigue resistant
  - _Fast Twitch_ Type II, fast to reach peak tension times (50ms). Appear
    white due to less myoglobin (less things to store oxygen in muscle) thus
    looks white
    - Has multiple different subdivisions as well but most have few instances
      and thus have minimal impact on total muscle composition 
    - Experiences superior growth and protein synthesis compared to Type I
      (maybe, studies were biased)
  - Average human muscle composition is half Type I and half Type II, however,
    specific muscles have variability in composition. Likewise, differences
    in type of stress (strength training vs endurance training) can change
    ratios. 
- Motor Units
  - _Motor Neuron_ nerve cells that actuate skeletal muscles
  - _Motor Unit_ Single motor neuron and the fibers it innervates collectively

#### Responses and Adaptations

- Early improvements to resistance training are from neural improvements (rate
  coding, synchronization, recruitment, etc)
- Neural Drive: over time, more muscles are activated thus increased recruitment
- Muscle activation: combination of recruitment (number of muscle fibers) and
  rate coding (frequency of stimulation). 
  - **Size Principle** capacity to produce force is related to size of motor
    unit. The larger the unit, the more force it produces
- Muscle fiber recruitment is essential for hypertrophy but recruitment does 
  not mean hypertrophic response. 
- Motor Unit Synchronization
  - One or more motor units occurs simultaneously
  - Resistance training does not seem to increase synchronization but it can
    be done with other training (musicians have high synchronization rates)
- Antagonist Coactivation 
  - Antagonist coactivation goes down with resistance training to allow greater
    force production. 
  - This is seen in resistance training as well
- Doublets
  - Two spikes in activation 5ms apart during contraction 
  - Increases during resistance training 
- Protein Balance 
  - Proteins are broken down and reconstructed constantly in a state of 
    equilibrium where breakdown happens at the same rate of resconstruction. 
  - Breakdown outpaces rebuilding during fasting and rebuild outpaces breakdown
    after eating
  - Protein synthesis is complicated (p. 27-29), however protein translation 
    initiation is the rate-limiting step in synthesis
  - During resistance training, synthesis is suppressed and breakdown 
    (_proteolysis_) is heightened. Then balance is negative. 
  - ~48 hours after workout is when protein synthesis is elevated considerably
- Hypertrophy
  - Increase in size of muscle tissue
  - Gains occurs from adding sarcomeres in parallel (but can also happen in
    series)
    - **REMINDER** Sarcomeres are the basic building blocks of myofibrils, 
      which are the basic rod-like units of muscle fibers, bundles of which
      make fasciculi, and bundles of those make muscles 
  - Mechanical overload causes all this to begin
  - When sarcomeres are added in series, then muscle becomes longer due to an 
    adaptation in length 
  - Eccentric predominant actions lengthen muscles (add sarcomeres in series)
    whereas concentric predominant actions shortens muscles (removes in series)
  - Hypertrophy can occur in series or in parallel, but observable gains are 
    seen largely with sarcomere additions in series. 
    - New adaptations are not seen much after 5 weeks of resistance training
      so you need to alter the style periodically 
- Sarcoplasmic Hypertrophy
  - Gains can occur from increase in non-muscle fiber stuff, like collagen, 
    organelles, and the fluids therein. For example, one study showed a
    drastic increase in water within muscles after 16 weeks of training
