## Neuromuscular System

#### Structure and Function

- Muscle is encased in layers of connected tissue. Within the encasement is 
  bundles of fiber with their own incasement. The bundles contain tons of 
  individual fibers covered by their own encasement
  - _Epimysium_ the outermost encasement
  - _Fasciculi_ the bundles of fiber in the muscle
  - _Perimysium_ encasements around the fasciculi
  - _Endomysium_ encasements around the individual fibers 
  - _Myocytes_ individual muscle fibers. 
  - Muscles are bundles of fasciculi which are bundles of myocytes 
- Skeletal muscles (muscles attached to bones) have multiple nuclei 
  (_multinucleated_) which allows protein production and thus growth 
- A single fiber (myocyte) contains tons of _myofibrils_, rod-like units in the
  fibers.
  - Myofibrils are long stacks of _sarcomeres_ connected end-to-end 
  - Sarcomeres contain thin and thick filaments which pass each other to 
    contract as part of the _Sliding Filament Theory_ to move muscles.
- Fiber Types
  - _Slow Twitch_ Type I fibers, slow to reach peak tension time (relatively
    speaking, still reach it in 110ms). Appear red due to higher levels of 
    myoglobin (more things to store oxygen) and thus fatigue resistant
  - _Fast Twitch_ Type II, fast to reach peak tension times (50ms). Appear
    white due to less myoglobin (less things to store oxygen in muscle) thus
    looks white
    - Has multiple different subdivisions as well but most have few instances
      and thus have minimal impact on total muscle composition 
    - Experiences superior growth and protein synthesis compared to Type I
      (maybe, studies were biased)
  - Average human muscle composition is half Type I and half Type II, however,
    specific muscles have variability in composition. Likewise, differences
    in type of stress (strength training vs endurance training) can change
    ratios.
