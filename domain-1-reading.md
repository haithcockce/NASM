Chapters 2-5, 17, 18

## Chapter 2: Basic Exercise Science

- The nervous, skeletal, and muscular systems cooperate to perform human
  movement
  - aka the _kinetic chain_ and _human movement system_

### The Nervous System

- Network of neuron divided into the Central Nervous System and Peripheral
  Nervous System.
- Functions include _sensory_ (input/stimuli, _afferent_), _integrative_
  (interpret input, _interneurons_),
  and _motor_ (output/movement, _efferent_)
- _Proprioception_ ability to sense relative positions of body parts (allows us
  to know what kind of surface you run on)

##### Anatomy of the Nervous System

- _Neuron_ allows a body to communicate with the world and itself via electrical
  and chemical signals. Large
  amounts of these create nerves
  - Nucleus connects to effector sites (muscles/organs) via axons
- _Afferent_ or sensory neurons receive stimuli, like a hot surface;
  _Interneurons_ carry the signal across multiple neurons up to and away from
  the brain; _Efferent_ or motor neurons react to the stimuli, like recoiling
  away from the hot surface

##### CNS/PNS

- _CNS_ central nervous system made of brain and spinal cord, _PNS_ peripheral
  nervous system
  - PNS provides pathways from CNS to affector sites via sensory and motor
    neurons
  - PNS' motor neurons is made of _somatic_ nervous system (for voluntary
    movement like skeletal muscles) and _autonomic_ nervous system (for
    involuntary movement like heart pulse/digestion/enocrine glands)
    - Autonomic divided further into _sympathetic_ (activity increase) and
      _parasympathetic_ (activity decrease) systems
- _Mechanorecpetors_ respond to mechanical pressure within tissue and transmit
  over sensory nerves, so like touch/pressure/stretching/motion/etc. Include
  Joint receptors/golgi tendons/muscle spindles
  - _Muscle Spindles_ run parallel to muscles and detect muscle stretching and
    forces contraction in overstretching
  - _Golgi Tendon Organs_ located at insertion points, detect muscle tension and
    stimulate muscle relaxation
  - _Joint Recptors_ located in and around joint capsule and detect motion
    within joints

### Skeletal System

- Provides shape and form, support and protection, allows bodily movement.
- Tendons connect muscles to bones
- _Bones_ create junctions called _joints_ connected by muscle and connective
  tissue where movement occurs due to contractions.

##### Divisions of Skeletal System

- _Axial_ is skull, rib cage, and vertebral column and is made of ~80 bones
- _Appendicular_ is extremities and shoulder/pelvic girdles. **Think appendages
  starting with the same thing as appendicular**
- Bones act as levers for movement and to provide support

### Bones

- _Remodeling_ renewing bones
- Most of this was skipped due to not ever seeing it in quizzes

### Joints

- _Arthrokinematics_ joint motion

###### Joint Connective Tissue

- _Ligaments_ connect joints and provide proprioceptive input to nervous system.
  - Made of collagen and some elastin

### Muscular System

- Three types of muscles, skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles
- Muscles are bundles of muscle fibers, each wrapped up by the fascia or
  _epimysium_ (think epidermis), inside are several fascicles wrapped up by
  _perimysium_, and each of these fascicles are made up of single muscle fibers
  wrapped up by _endomysium_. So, you have individual fibers encased with the
  _endomysium_, these individual fibers are bundled up as fasciculus and encased
  with _perimysium_, and these fascicles are bundled up and encased in
  _epimysium_. The _epimysium_ are connected to bones with tendons.
- At an extremely low level, muscles are made up of _sarcomere_ which consists
  of thin and thick filaments and a Z line. When the thin and thick filaments
  slide past each other shortening the _sarcomere_, the muscle flexes
  - This is the **Sliding Filament Theory**
- A _motor unit_ is the motor neuron and the muscle fibers it connects to
  - **All or nothing law** if a stimulus is enough to trigger the neuron(s) in a
    motor unit, then the entire muscle is innervated, otherwise, no innervation
    occurs. Thus all or nothing.

##### Muscle Fiber Types

- Type 1
  - Slow twitch, tons of capillaries and myoglobin which provides better oxygen
    for muscles. These are red and thus Type 1 are red fibers. Resist fatigue
    and smaller.
- Type 2
  - Fast twitch, less capillaries and myoglobin, thus less oxygen and thus
    fatigue quickly. Larger.
  - 2.x have the least myoglobin and low oxidative capacity and fatigue the fastest
  - 2.a have some more myoglobin and can use aerobic and anaerobic equally.

## Chapter 3: The Cardiorespiratory System

- Typical resting heartrate is 70-80 BPM
- _Atria_ chambers for receiving blood (**think** atrium, the entrance)
- _Pulmonary_ right side dealing with deoxygenated blood (gets blood to lungs)
- _Systemic_ left side and pushes oxygenated blood out to body
- _Stroke volume_ amount of blood pumped out with each contraction
- _Cardiac output_ stroke volume over time
- _Arteries_ Carry blood away from heart (**think** _a_ rteries and _a_ way)
- _Veins_ carry blood to heart (**think** vein sounds like vain, self-centered)
- Regular breathing requires diaphragm and intercostals while heavy breathing
  requires scalenes and pec minor

## Chapter 4: Exercise Metabolism and Bioenergetics

##### Macros/Substrates

- Food is broken down into _substrates_ (what we know as macros, carbs, protein,
  fats). Carbs are our main source of energy
- Carbs are broken down into _glucose_ is what circulates and is absorbed
  - **Think** Insulin helps absorb this. So lack of insulin leads to high blood
    sugar. The blood sugar is the glucose circulating the blood.
  - Glucose is stored as _glycogen_ in liver and muscles and are chains of
    glucose ready to be broken down and used in intense/prolonged workouts.
    - **Think** _Gl_ ucose makes up _gl_ ycogen
- Fats store excess calories made as _triglycerides_ which is stored in fat cells
- Proteins can be used as energy but shouldn't. When we do, then we are starving
  and the body is using proteins as amino acids for energy in _gluconeogenesis_

##### Energy and Work

- ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) breaking down releases energy to perform muscle
  contractions quickly.
  - This is the first source of energy and is very short lived
  - Energy is also required to rebuild the ATP from ADP and is called the
    _ATP-PC system_
  - ATP-PC is **anaerobic** and the energy produced from this occurs for 10-15 s
    but occurs on the onset of any intensity of activity
- _Glycolysis_
  - Lasts 30-50 s
  - Anaerobic version breaks down glucose to lactic acid  
  - Aerobic version breaks down glucose to pyruvic acid
  - Majority of glycogen stores are depleted after 90 minutes of exercise
- Oxidative systems
  - Aerobic glycolysis falls under here when making pyruvic acid
  - Pyruvic acid is used to make Acetyl CoA for Krebs cycle which release CO2
    and H2
  - H2 combines with stuff to form ATP in the electron transport chain
  - Metabolising a glucose molecule can create 35-40 ATP though YMMV
  - Fat is metabolised by breaking down triglycerides with beta-oxidation to
    create FFA (free fatty acids) which then become acetyl CoA and then the rest
    of the stuff after that (krebs then electron transport chain)
- **Summary**
  - Anaerobic
    - ATP-PC for 10-15 sec
    - Anaerobic glycolysis for lactic acid for 35-40 sec
  - Aerobic
    - Aerobic Glycolysis for pyruvic acid for 35-40 sec
    - Oxidative System (oxidation of glucose and fat)
- _EPOC_ Excess Postexercise Oxygen Consumption, effectively while resting after
  a workout, the body has an elevated metabolism to oxidate stuff and generate
  more ATP to replenish it in the muscles.
- Short intense work, however, ATP is recovered at 90 seconds

## Chapter 5: Human Movement Science

- Most of this is terminology to describe anatomy (saggital, concentric, etc)
- _Force-Velocity Curve_
  - As velocity of concentric increases, force production decreases
  - As velocity of eccentric increases, force development increases
  - This is because of Length-Tension relationship of thin/thick filaments. As
    they pull apart, thin/thick filaments in muscles pull apart and come
    together on contraction. When too close, you can not produce more force
    (thus concentric force production decreases as velocity increases), and when
    far apart, they do not produce a lot of force but have the most potential to
    produce force (thus velocity of eccentric muscle action increases and brings
    more potential for force development)
- _Force-couple_ synergistic action of muscles to produce movement around a joint
