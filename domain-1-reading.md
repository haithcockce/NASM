## Chapter 2: Basic Exercise Science

- The nervous, skeletal, and muscular systems cooperate to perform human movement
  - aka the _kinetic chain_ and _human movement system_

#### The Nervous System

- Network of neuron divided into the Central Nervous System and Peripheral Nervous System. 
- Functions include _sensory_ (input/stimuli, _afferent_), _integrative_ (interpret input, _interneurons_), 
  and _motor_ (output/movement, _efferent_)
- _Proprioception_ ability to sense relative positions of body parts (allows us to know what kind of surface
  you run on)

##### Anatomy of the Nervous System

- _Neuron_ allows a body to communicate with the world and itself via electrical and chemical signals. Large
  amounts of these create nerves
  - Nucleus connects to effector sites (muscles/organs) via axons
- _Afferent_ or sensory neurons receive stimuli, like a hot surface; _Interneurons_ carry the signal across
  multiple neurons up to and away from the brain; _Efferent_ or motor neurons react to the stimuli, like recoiling
  away from the hot surface

##### CNS/PNS

- _CNS_ central nervous system made of brain and spinal cord, _PNS_ peripheral nervous system
  - PNS provides pathways from CNS to affector sites via sensory and motor neurons
  - PNS is made of _somatic_ nervous system (for voluntary movement like skeletal muscles) and
    _autonomic_ nervous system (for involuntary movement like heart pulse/digestion/enocrine glands)
    - Autonomic divided further into _sympathetic_ and _parasympathetic_ systems
