Chapters 2-5, 17, 18

## Chapter 2: Basic Exercise Science

- The nervous, skeletal, and muscular systems cooperate to perform human
  movement
  - aka the _kinetic chain_ and _human movement system_

### The Nervous System

- Network of neuron divided into the Central Nervous System and Peripheral
  Nervous System.
- Functions include _sensory_ (input/stimuli, _afferent_), _integrative_
  (interpret input, _interneurons_),
  and _motor_ (output/movement, _efferent_)
- _Proprioception_ ability to sense relative positions of body parts (allows us
  to know what kind of surface you run on)

##### Anatomy of the Nervous System

- _Neuron_ allows a body to communicate with the world and itself via electrical
  and chemical signals. Large
  amounts of these create nerves
  - Nucleus connects to effector sites (muscles/organs) via axons
- _Afferent_ or sensory neurons receive stimuli, like a hot surface;
  _Interneurons_ carry the signal across multiple neurons up to and away from
  the brain; _Efferent_ or motor neurons react to the stimuli, like recoiling
  away from the hot surface

##### CNS/PNS

- _CNS_ central nervous system made of brain and spinal cord, _PNS_ peripheral
  nervous system
  - PNS provides pathways from CNS to affector sites via sensory and motor
    neurons
  - PNS' motor neurons is made of _somatic_ nervous system (for voluntary
    movement like skeletal muscles) and _autonomic_ nervous system (for
    involuntary movement like heart pulse/digestion/enocrine glands)
    - Autonomic divided further into _sympathetic_ (activity increase) and
      _parasympathetic_ (activity decrease) systems
- _Mechanorecpetors_ respond to mechanical pressure within tissue and transmit
  over sensory nerves, so like touch/pressure/stretching/motion/etc. Include
  Joint receptors/golgi tendons/muscle spindles
  - _Muscle Spindles_ run parallel to muscles and detect muscle stretching and
    forces contraction in overstretching
  - _Golgi Tendon Organs_ located at insertion points, detect muscle tension and
    stimulate muscle relaxation
  - _Joint Recptors_ located in and around joint capsule and detect motion
    within joints

### Skeletal System

- Provides shape and form, support and protection, allows bodily movement.
- Tendons connect muscles to bones
- _Bones_ create junctions called _joints_ connected by muscle and connective
  tissue where movement occurs due to contractions.

##### Divisions of Skeletal System

- _Axial_ is skull, rib cage, and vertebral column and is made of ~80 bones
- _Appendicular_ is extremities and shoulder/pelvic girdles. **Think appendages
  starting with the same thing as appendicular**
- Bones act as levers for movement and to provide support

### Bones

- _Remodeling_ renewing bones
- Most of this was skipped due to not ever seeing it in quizzes

### Joints

- _Arthrokinematics_ joint motion

###### Joint Connective Tissue

- _Ligaments_ connect joints and provide proprioceptive input to nervous system.
  - Made of collagen and some elastin

### Muscular System

- Skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles
