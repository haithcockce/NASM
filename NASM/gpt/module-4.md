# Designing Group Personal Training Programs

Key questions: 

- How mnay people can be included in each session? 
- How much space will be allocated for the program sessions? 
- What type of equpiment will be at her disposal? 
- How will she know the fitness level of th eparticipants in each session? 
- What will be the best style of programming? 

When to collect assessments: 

- Separate appointments on an individual basis
- Give participants easy assessments to perform on each other (circumference measurements for example)
- Integrate assessments within workouts (have group perform OHS and monitor all)
- When the client is comfortable with it
- When it makes sense to collect it
  - for example, if a client wants to transition from conditioning to weight loss. Circumference measurements won't be useful for conditioning but will be for weight loss.
  - Movement efficiency and Musculoskeletal alignment assessments are always good to start with however since training new or experienced individuals requires movement

What to collect: 

- Objective (measurements) and subjective (self-reported) data
- Subjective: 
  - Health Risk Appraisals (like PAR-Q, ACSM/AHA Participation Screening Questionnaire, etc)
  - Medical/Health History
  - Occupation/lifestyle habits
- Objective
  - Musculoskeletal alignment and movement efficiency 
  - Body Composition and Respiratory assessments 

- Static Postural Assessment
  - Check the five kinetic chain points
    - Foot and ankles should be straight and parallel without inversion/eversion (inward/outward rotation respectively) and no external rotation
    - Knees should be inline with toes and not abducted (outward rotation) or adducted (inward rotation)
    - Lumbo-pelvic-hip (LPH) complex should be level and neutral (no anterior/posterior tilt or lateral tilt)
    - Upper spine and shoulders are level and not elevated or protracted
    - Head is in a neutral position and not tilted, rotated, or pushed forward
  - Common Distortions: 
    - Lower Cross syndrome: marked by butt sticking out due to weak abs and glutes and overactive erector spinae, hip flexors, and/or lats
    - Upper Cross Syndrome: marked by rounded back and head sticking out due to weak traps, rotator cuffs, and cervical flexors and overactive pecs and cervical extendors
    - Pronation Distortion Syndrome marked by knees being internally rotated and feet flattening (eversion a little) due to weak foot inversion muscles (anterior/posterior tibialis) and external hip rotators (glutes) and overactive calves, hamstrings, inner thighs, hip flexors, and TFL

- Dynamic Movement Assessments
  - Overhead Squat Assessment (OHS) 
    - Anterior view: check knees coming in/feet flattening
    - Lateral view: check bending forward too far, spine being curved too much, or arms falling forward

- Fitness Assessments: 
  - Pushup test, pullup test, mile run, wall sit, hover test (planking), air squat test
  - Make sure to perform at beginning of workout/warmup since exhaustion can make this a skewed assessment after the workout
  
Application of assessments and Group training considerations:
- Baseline assessments should be done before client participation 
- For clients uncomfortable with measurements, consider doing it separately or later on after a few sessions and confidence has built some
- Consider followup assessments from time to time for longer programs
- Incorporate assessments as warmups
- Adjust the exercises based on assessments (some people may need to progress or regress an exercise or the exercise may need to be removed completely) 
- Short term (2-3 weeks out) and long term (6 months out) goals can be made after assessments 
- Make sure all participants needs are met as best as possible (scale up and down where needed, keep things engaging, use proper modalities and equipment for skill level, etc)
