# Designing Group Personal Training Programs

Key questions: 

- How mnay people can be included in each session? 
- How much space will be allocated for the program sessions? 
- What type of equpiment will be at her disposal? 
- How will she know the fitness level of th eparticipants in each session? 
- What will be the best style of programming? 

When to collect assessments: 

- Separate appointments on an individual basis
- Give participants easy assessments to perform on each other (circumference measurements for example)
- Integrate assessments within workouts (have group perform OHS and monitor all)
- When the client is comfortable with it
- When it makes sense to collect it (for example, if a client wants to transition from conditioning to weight loss. Circumference measurements won't be useful for conditioning but will be for weight loss)

What to collect: 

- Objective (measurements) and subjective (self-reported) data
- Subjective: 
  - Health Risk Appraisals (like PAR-Q, ACSM/AHA Participation Screening Questionnaire, etc)
  - Medical/Health History
  - Occupation/lifestyle habits
- Objective
  - Musculoskeletal alignment and movement efficiency 
  - Body Composition and Respiratory assessments
