## Basic and Applied Sciences

#### Cardiorespiratory System

- Combination of cardiovascular and respiratory systems, or the systems for
  blood transport and oxygen transport of oxygen into the bloodstream
  - Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from heart
  - Vein carry CO2 blood away from heart

- Changes to the body during exercise:
  - Early changes include blood pressure increase due to vasoconstriction of
    inactive muscles (active muscles will be prioritized for getting oxygen) as
    well as heart rate increase.
  - Body works towards oxygen stead state (supply meeting demand) so more
    increase in heart rate, stroke volume (amount of blood per pump), and
    cardiac output

- Late changes: body temp will eventually rise and cause decreased stroke volume
  and thus lowered plasma levels, dehydration, and vasodilation, blood to skin
  (to help cool body), increased heart rate (aka cardiovascular drift)
  particularly after 30 minutes of lower intensity exercises
- Long term effects (**chronic adaptations**) include lowered resting heart rate
  and blood pressure, increased cardiac output, and lowered risk for type 2
  diabetes

  - **Blood Pressure** is the pressure of the blood against arterial walls and
    is measured with pressure when heart contracts (top number, systolic) and
    relaxes (bottom number, diastolic)
  - 120/80 for men and 110/70 for women is healthy
  - 140/90 is _hypertension_

- Respiratory system is for breathing, moving oxygen into blood
- **VO2 Max** capacity to transport and use the oxygen a body takes in during
  maximal exercise in the form of ATP
  - ml of O2  / kg of body weight / min of exercise
  - Males typically have a larger VO2 max
  - Lungs are fine and typically it is the cardiovascular system that limits vo2
- Acute changes include increased respiration rate (breaths-per-minute)
- Chronic changes include better O2 delivery to muscles

- Monitor how people leave an ideal static position after putting them in such
- Check on asthma and COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)!

#### Bioenergetics

- **Adenosine Triphosphate** is main energy source for muscles and made with
  oxygen (aerobically) or without (anaerobically)
- Systems
  - ATP-PC (ATP with phosphate) rapid anaerobic ATP source lasting for ~30 sec
  - Glycolysis: main energy system for moderate to high intensity stuff for
    30-120 seconds. Fast (anaerobically) first then slower (aerobically)
  - Oxidative phosphorylation, solely aerobic and for resting state or
    long-lasting low-intensity exercises

#### Body Composition

- When doing group weight loss, consider different caloric needs from resting
  metabolic rate (RMR), thermogenesis, physical activity, age, body size and
  current composition, etc
  - RMR is the caloric requirements to simply exist and consumes 60-75% of cals
