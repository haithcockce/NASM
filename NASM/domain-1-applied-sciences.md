### Terminology

- __Kinesiology__ Study of human movement
- __Biomechanics__ Stud of how forces affect a living body
- Forces applied to body can be internal (pressude from breathing in) or external (wind resistence, weights at the gym, etc) 

### Biomechanics

#### Anatomic Locations

- Provides a common protocol to describe the body parts and movements. 
- Standing up, arms to side, and palms facing out 
- Locations
  - _Anterior_ towards the front (face/chest)
  - _Posterior_ towards the back (glutes, scapulae)
  - _Superior_ above or close to a head (think further out and up)
  - _Inferior_ towards the bottom part or closer to the feet (think further in or down)
  - _Proximal_ closer to the center
  - _Distal_ farther away from center or a landmark
  - _Medial_ towards the middle
  - _Lateral_ away from the middle
- Locations can also be relative (Pectoralis Major is medial to the Deltoids for example)

#### Joint Positions

- Terms
  - _Prone_ Lay face down
  - _Supine_ lay face up
  - _Triple Flexion_ multijoint exercise that involves hip, knee, and ankle flexing simultaneously (think squat, where all are flexed)
  - _Triple Extension_ same as triple flexion except extension (like the top of a jump)
  - _Static Posture_ Starting point of an individual move (not the same as ideal posture!)

#### Planes of Joint Motion

- In general, these are the planes where movements are usually parallel to movement. This divides the body into "halves" or "sides" where movement occurs.
- Types 
  - _Sagittal_ Splits into left and right, typically flexion and extension (squats, running, etc). Typically movement that is forward and back.
  - _Frontal_ Splits into front and back (anterior/posterior!), typically abduction and adduction movements that go left and right.
  - _Transverse_ Splits into top and bottom. Rotational movements, and some movements may not seem rotational (like pushups) 
- Many exercises cross multiple planes!

#### Joint Actions

- Terms
  - _Flexion_ bending where the angle made shrinks
  - _Extensions_ bending where angle made grows
  - _Abduction_ body part moves away from the midline (from medial to lateral or proximal to distal)
  - _Adduction_ body part moves towards the midline (from lateral to medial or distal to proximal)
  - _Horizonal Adduction_
  - _Hosizontal Abduction_
  - Internal Rotation rotation towards midline
  - External Rotation rotation away from midline
  - Pronation triplanar movement associated with force reduction
  - Supination force production
  
#### Muscle 

- Eccentric Lengthening of muscle and force reduction (force less than load)
- Isometric no change and stabilize. Think farmers walks or carrying groceries to the car. 
- Concentric shortening and force production (force greater than load)

#### Common Muscle Imbalances

- _Malalignment_ bad alignment when being still (bent over at a desk for example)
- _Overactive_ NM recruitment patterns that lead muscle to be more active (IE the muscle is turning on when it shouldn't)
- _Underactive_ NM recruitment patterns that lead muscle to be less active (IE the muscle is turned off when it shouldn't)

#### Common Imbalances

- Check slides! NEED TO KNOW THESE

### Human Movement System

- Made 3 systems that make up the kinetic chain

#### Nervous System

- Central Nervous System (CNS) that provides communication network within body
- Functions
  - _Sensory_ sensing changes in internal or external environment
  - _Integrative_
  - _Motor_
- _Proprioception_ ability to sense the relative position of adjacent parts of the body. IE You just"know" where your body parts are and what position they are in
  - Important for efficient movement due to related to balance, coordination, posture
- Movement is a response to sensory information and is therefore dictated by the nervous system
  - THIS IS WHAT WE TRAIN, not the muscles. At the very least, train the nervous system properly
- Peripheral Nervous System
  - Connection for the CNS to activate bodily organs and relay information from organs back to brain and providing constant sensory info. It's like the internet of the body
  - _Somatic_ serves communications between brain and voluntary things like muscles
  - _autonomic_ neural input to involuntary systems of the body
- Mechanoreceptors 
  - Muscle Spindle - sensitive to changes in muscle length and rate of change in length
  - Golgi Tendon Organ - changes in muscular tension and rate of tension change
  - Joint Receptors - pressures and accel/deceleration of the joint 

#### Muscular System

- Muscles generate internal tension under the control of the CNS to move bones and produce movement
- Connective Tissues
  - Tendons which attach muscles to bone (muscle to bone). Poor blood supply and thus slower repair. 
  - Muscle Fibers - they have cell plasma (sarcoplasm), nucleus, mitochondria, but also myofibers
    - Type 1 smaller, more oxygen delivery, lots of energy supply thus endurance. Slow twitch
    - Type 2 larger, less oxygen and energy supply, more force but quick to fatigue (power) Fast Twitch
- Muscles as movers
  - Agonists - Prime mover (concentric movements mostly)
  - Synergists - help prime mover (thus concentric)

- Reciprocal Inhibition - Contraction of a muscle and relaxation of antagonist to allow movement (bicep curl has biceps flex but triceps relax)
