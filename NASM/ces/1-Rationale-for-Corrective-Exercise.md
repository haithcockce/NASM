## Rationale for Corrective Exercise

* People are less active than they used to be and PE/after school programs are being cut
* About 1/3 of adults are obese. 
* This is creating an environment that promotes muscle dysfunction and injury
* Clients are not typically ready to start at the same level of difficulty as people did 20 years ago

### Musculoskeletal Pain

* MS pain is more common that 40 years ago so less activity could be the cause of MS pain and injury
* Low back pain effects 80% of adults, 1/3 of all injuries involve trunk and 60% of that is the low back specifically
* Shoulder impingement is 40-65% of all reported shoulder pain
* Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injuries are estimated to be at 80000-100,000 occurrences annually and is a strong correlation to knee arthritis, and occur between the ages of 15-25 most commonly. 70-75% of ACL injuries are from non-contact 

### Corrective Exercise Continuum

* **Corrective Exercise** systematic process of identifying neuromusculoskeletal dysfunction, developing a plan of action, and implementing an integrated corrective strategy
* Process: Identify (integrated assessment), solve (corrective program design), implement (exercise technique)
* **Corrective Exercise Continuum** systematic plan of four phases to introduce corrective exercise. 
* 4 phases: 
	* Inhibit (release tension, self-myofascial release)
	* Lengthening (increase extensibility and range of motion)
	* Activate (reduce/increase activation of underactive tissues) 
	* Integrate (retrain collective synergistic function of all muscles through progressive movements)
* Need to take assessments (movement, range of motion, and muscle strength) to determine dysfunctions and how to design corrective exercise programs
